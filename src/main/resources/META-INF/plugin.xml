    Alzak icon is based on the mascot of Alza.cz a.s. company, all rights for his creation are reserved to them.<br><br>
    This plugin is based on the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12875-gopher">Gopher Progress Bar plugin</a> by Florin Pățan.

    All work should be attributed to him, I just changed the icon and the bar color.

    Gopher icon based on the gopher created by Renee French under Creative Commons 3.0 Attributions.

    Based on the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8575-nyan-progress-bar">Nyan Progress Bar plugin> by Dmitry Batkovich.
